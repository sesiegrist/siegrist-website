Neurosecretory neurons in the brain synthesize and secrete a myriad of neuropeptides, hormones and other neuromodulatory factors that coordinate tissue growth and homeostasis with overall animal growth and physiology. How are these neuronal circuits architected and how do these circuits affect NSC proliferation to coordinate overall brain growth with overall organismal growth?
