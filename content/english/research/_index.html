Basic autonomous and higher voluntary cognitive functions of the brain require production of an immense diversity of neuron types at the right place and time, as well as correct wiring of these neurons into an array of functional neuronal circuits. In the Siegrist Lab, we are working to understand how the immense number of molecularly and functionally distinct neuron types are produced during development and importantly, how natural environments impact generation of neuron number and diversity in animals living in the real world. Research in the Siegrist lab is focused on the following fundamental themes and questions.
