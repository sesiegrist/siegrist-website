Neural stem cells express different transcription factors and signaling molecules over time, which allows for sequential generation of different neuron types. We are working to identify additional neural stem cell intrinsic factors that regulate temporal identity and are investigating how dietary nutrients and steroid hormones influence timing of NSC temporal transitions and timing of neurogenesis termination.
