Neural stem cells express different transcription factors and signaling molecules over time, which allows for sequential generation of different neuron types over time. We are working to identify additional neural stem cell intrinsic factors that regulate temporal identity and are investigating how dietary nutrients and steroid hormones influence timing of NSC temporal transitions. During development, neural tissues, including the brain, become progressively more sophisticated and complex: neuron numbers increase as well as the molecular and functional diversity of neuron types produced. Yet, at the same time, the capacity for generating different neuron types decrease over time. We are investigating how neurogenesis becomes progressively restricted during development.
