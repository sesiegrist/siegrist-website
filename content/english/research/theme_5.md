Why are not all brains the same even in a given species? Do evolutionary pressures lead to adaptations that manifest in distinct NSC proliferation patterns in response to environmental conditions and ultimately varied brain organization? With these questions in mind, we are working to determine how dietary nutrient availability impacts brain development in laboratory maintained and in wild caught isogenized Drosophila from northern and southern latitudes, whose genomes have been sequenced.
