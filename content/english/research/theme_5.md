Bones and skin have an amazing ability to self-repair. Even the liver can fully regenerate after a partial hepatectomy. In contrast, neural tissues, including the brain have an extremely limited ability to self-repair. We are working to understand the limited regenerative capacity of adult neural tissues and on developing methods to remake brain structures through reinitiation of developmental programs.
