We are working to develop better methods to ablate defined sets of cells in a temporally controlled manner. With new ablation methods, we are working to understand the limited regenerative capacity of neural tissues. Understanding how organisms respond to injury and repair tissue damage is an outstanding and fundamental question in biology.
