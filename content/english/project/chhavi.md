Neural stem cells, like other stem cells switch between quiescence and proliferation as part of normal developmental programs, during adult homeostasis, and for repairing tissue after damage. Quiescence versus proliferation decisions require coordination of stem cell-intrinsic factors with extrinsic factors, local and systemic, that vary in response to changing animal physiology. We are working to understand the lineage-specific intrinsic programs that govern neural stem cell proliferation decisions in respond to dietary nutrient availability.
