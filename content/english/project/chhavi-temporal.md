During development, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide asymmetrically, sequentially
expressing a series of intrinsic factors to generate a diversity of neuron types. After
cycling through temporal programs, NSCs terminally differentiate or die, bringing an
end to developmental neurogenesis. From a screen aimed at identifying genes
required to terminate neurogenesis, we identified Notch and Notch pathway
components. When Notch is knocked down in neuroblasts ( Drosophila NSCs) or
their glial niche, neurogenesis extends into adulthood due to defects in neuroblast
temporal programs: early Cas/Svp/Imp expression is prolonged and late Syp/E93
expression is delayed or reduced. Notch activity is regulated by Delta, expressed in
neuroblast and cortex glial neighbors, and Delta localization is regulated by neuroblast
temporal factors: early Imp promotes Delta and late Syp/E93 inhibits Delta. Together,
temporal programs restrict Delta-dependent Notch activity to "young" neuroblasts and
Notch inhibits early temporal factor expression to promote NSC lineage progression
and timing neurogenesis termination.
