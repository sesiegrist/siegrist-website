We continue to make use of _Drosophila_ as a genetic model to identify genes required for termination of neurogenesis. Through screening, using UAS-RNAi lines generated by the Transgeneic RNAi Project (TRiP), we have identified 14 genes. We continue to screen additional UAS-RNAi lines and are working to determine how the genes identified so far lead to neurogenesis termination. In brief, we have determined that some are required for autophagy and/or apoptosis as well as NB temporal and spatial patterning.
