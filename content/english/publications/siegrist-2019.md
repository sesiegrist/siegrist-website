Neurogenesis initiates and terminates in a spatially and temporally defined manner. Most neurogenesis occurs during development driven by the cell divisions of neural stem cells, but in some animals new neurons are also produced throughout adulthood. In adults, however, neurogenesis is rather limited; only certain neuron types are produced in only a few brain regions. Better understanding of how neurogenesis terminates once development is complete could help in devising therapies to restore neurogenesis in damaged brain regions as well as in treatment of brain tumors.
