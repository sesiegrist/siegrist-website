Cortical polarity regulates cell division, migration, and differentiation. Microtubulesinduce cortical polarity in yeast, but few ex-amples are known in metazoans. We showthat astral microtubules, kinesin Khc-73,and Discs large (Dlg) induce cortical polari-zation of Pins/GaiinDrosophilaneuro-blasts; this cortical domain is functional forgenerating spindle asymmetry, daughter-cell-size asymmetry, and distinct siblingfates. Khc-73 localizesto astral microtubuleplus ends, and Dlg/Khc-73 and Dlg/Pins co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that micro-tubules induce Pins/Gai cortical polaritythrough Dlg/Khc-73 interactions. The mi-crotubule/Khc-73/Dlg pathway acts in par-allel to the well-characterized Inscuteable/Parpathway,buteachprovidesuniquespa-tial and temporal information: The Inscute-able/Par pathway initiates at prophase tocoordinate neuroblast cortical polarity withCNS tissue polarity, whereas the micro-tubule/Khc-73/Dlg pathway functions atmetaphasetocoordinateneuroblastcorticalpolarity with the mitotic spindle axis. Theseresults identify a role for microtubules in po-larizing the neuroblast cortex, a fundamen-tal step for generating cell diversity throughasymmetric cell division.
