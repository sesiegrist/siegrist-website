Temporal patterning of neural progenitors, in which differentfactors are sequentially expressed, is an evolutionarilyconserved strategy for generating neuronal diversity duringdevelopment. In the Drosophila embryo, mechanisms thatmediate temporal patterning of neural stem cells (neuroblasts)are largely cell-intrinsic. However, after embryogenesis,neuroblast temporal patterning relies on extrinsic cues as well,as freshly hatched larvae seek out nutrients and other keyresources in varying natural environments. We recap currentunderstanding of neuroblast-intrinsic temporal programs anddiscuss how neuroblast extrinsic cues integrate and coordinatewith neuroblast intrinsic programs to control numbers andtypes of neurons produced. One key emerging extrinsic factorthat impacts temporal patterning of neuroblasts and theirdaughters as well as termination of neurogenesis is the steroidhormone, ecdysone, a known regulator of large-scaledevelopmental transitions in insects and arthropods. Lastly, weconsider evolutionary conservation and discuss recent work onthyroid hormone signaling in early vertebrate braindevelopment.
