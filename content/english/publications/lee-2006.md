An important question in stem cell biology is howa cell decides to self-renew or differentiate.Drosophilaneuroblasts divide asymmetrically to self-renew andgenerate differentiating progeny called GMCs. Here,we report that the Brain tumor (Brat) translation re-pressor is partitioned into GMCs via direct interactionwith the Miranda scaffolding protein. Inbratmutants,another Miranda cargo protein (Prospero) is not parti-tioned into GMCs, GMCs fail to downregulate neuro-blast gene expression, and there is a massive increasein neuroblast numbers. Single neuroblast clones lack-ing Prospero have a similar phenotype. We concludethat Brat suppresses neuroblast stem cell self-renewaland promotes neuronal differentiation.
