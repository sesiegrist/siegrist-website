Taylor started her research career many moons ago as a lab tech in the Condron lab here at UVA.  Since then, she graduated with her bachelorâ€™s from the University of Colorado - Boulder, worked at Columbia University building the INSITE collection of Gal4 lines, and taught middle school science and PE.  Now she is back at UVA as a graduate student, working on a collaboration between the Siegrist and Bergland labs.  She is interested in the effects of environmental factors on neurodevelopment in natural populations.  When not playing with larvae in the lab, Taylor can be found climbing rocks, watering her plants, or finding excuses to buy more books.
