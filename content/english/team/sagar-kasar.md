I  obtained my bachelor of science in biotechnology from University of Mumbai, India. Next, I graduated with master's degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania where I developed research interest in developmental biology while working on Wnt signaling pathway in zebrafish kidney development. In Siegrist lab, I am interested in understanding the crosstalk between different cell types in drosophila brain during the neural stem cell niche maintenance. I enjoy playing soccer, swimming, and biking.
