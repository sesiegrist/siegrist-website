Crystal is a 3rd-year undergraduate student here at UVA. She is on the pre-medical track and is majoring in Human Biology. She assists graduate student Taylor Nystrom in her neurodevelopment in natural populations project. She also plans to start her own research soon, as she is interested in the microbiome and neurogenesis. Outside of the lab, Crystal likes to hike, ski, and volunteer at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital!
