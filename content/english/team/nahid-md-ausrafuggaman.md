Nahid earned his Bachelors and Masters degree in Molecular Biology from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. His current research focus is on the molecular mechanisms that drive the nutrient-independent proliferation of the Mushroom Body neuroblasts in the Drosophila brain. He is found running around the UVA campus often and he dreams about running a marathon someday in the near future!
