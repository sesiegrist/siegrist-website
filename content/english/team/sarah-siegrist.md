Sarah earned her Ph.D. from the University of Oregon, where she studied regulation of asymmetric cell division in the lab of Chris Q. Doe. She carried out her post-doctoral research in Iswar Hariharan's lab at UC Berkeley, investigating growth regulation of the CNS during development. In her past life, Sarah was an avid rock climber and outdoor adventurer. Today, when not working in the lab, writing grants and papers, and preparing for class lectures, Sarah enjoys hiking and playing games with her family.
