Susie holds a B.A. in Biology and Classic Civilization from Wellesley College, and a Master's degree in Molecular Neuroscience from UniversitePierre-et-Marie-Curie (Paris 6). Her Ph.D. and postdoctoral work were done in the laboratory of Michael Menaker at the University of Virginia, where she studied circadian hormone and neurotransmitter rhythms in the mammalian retina and non-visual photoreception. Susie has a long-standing interest in biological timing, and in the Siegrist lab she is interested in exploring how extrinsic signalis integrate with stem cell intrinsic factors to control developmental timing.
