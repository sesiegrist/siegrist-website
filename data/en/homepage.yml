  description : "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known -- Carl Sagan"
  content : "We are a small academic research lab in the Biology department at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. Our lab is located in the Physical Life Sciences Building (PLSB) alongside a number of other academic labs whose research mission is geared toward better understanding fundamental principles governing animal development, from the single-cell zygote stage to formation of mature adults, with complex organs functioning seamlessly in parallel to maintain homeostasis. We are scientists-in-training (undergraduate and graduate students) and research scientists (PhDs) working together, side by side, to tackle BIG QUESTIONS in the field of developmental and regenerative biology. In particular, we are interested in how neural stem cells divide to generate such an immense diversity of neuron types during development and are interested in understanding how environmental factors impact neuron production and diversity. It is our hope that results from our research will provide new insight into methods to restore and replace neural tissue damaged by disease or injury."
