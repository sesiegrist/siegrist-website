  title : "About Us"
  description : "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known -- Carl Sagan"
  content : "We are a small academic research lab in the Biology department at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. Our lab is located on the third floor of the Physical Life Sciences Building immersed among a number of other research labs whose mission is all geared towards unraveling fundamental principles that govern animal development, from the single cell fertilized egg (zygote) to multi-cellular organisms with complex tissues. We are scientists-in-training (undergraduate and graduate students) and research scientists (PhDs) working together, side by side, to tackle BIG QUESTIONS in the field of developmental and regenerative biology. In particular, we are interested in how neural stem cells in the developing brain divide to generate such an immense diversity of neuron types. Understanding how neuron diversity is generated during development will provide insight into how restore and replace neural tissue damaged by disease or injury."
